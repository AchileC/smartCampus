very_hot_advice: "Very hot today. Consider lowering the radiator settings and ventilate the classroom by opening windows or doors to maintain a comfortable environment."
comfortable_temperature_advice: "Comfortable temperatures. Adjust radiator settings to maintain a pleasant classroom environment. Ventilate as needed to keep the air fresh."
freezing_temperature_advice: "Freezing temperatures. Ensure radiators are set to a higher temperature to keep the classroom warm. Keep windows closed to conserve heat."
cold_temperature_advice: "Cold today. Increase radiator settings as necessary and ensure windows are closed to maintain warmth."
extremely_low_temperature_advice: "Extremely low temperatures! Set radiators to maximum to ensure the classroom stays warm. Minimize window openings to retain heat."

heavy_rainfall_advice: "Heavy rainfall expected. Ensure windows are tightly closed to prevent humidity ingress. Use doors to ventilate if necessary."
moderate_rainfall_advice: "Moderate rainfall expected. Keep windows closed and use doors to ventilate the classroom as needed while avoiding excess humidity."
light_rainfall_advice: "Light rain expected. Ventilate the classroom by opening windows or doors briefly to refresh the air without allowing excessive humidity."

wet_conditions_advice: "Wet conditions anticipated. Ensure proper ventilation to avoid humidity buildup by using doors if opening windows is not ideal."
clear_weather_advice: "Clear or partly cloudy weather. Take the opportunity to ventilate the classroom by opening windows (or doors if it's too cold outside) during cooler parts of the day."
good_ventilation_conditions_advice: "Good conditions for ventilation. Open windows or doors during breaks to refresh the air without disrupting the classroom environment."
